## Abstract
> A Domain Specific Language (DSL) is a computer programming language of limited expressiveness focused on a particular domain. Most languages you hear of are General Purpose Languages, which can handle most things you run into during a software project. Each DSL can only handle one specific aspect of a system.

Domain specific languages allow us to create an ideal environment for solving a specific problem. In this talk weâ€™ll discuss how to use various language features like recursive enums, trailing closures and higher order functions to create elegant and type-safe domain specific languages.

We will go through real-world problems we encountered at Pinterest and will end by building a domain specific language for crafting type-safe GraphQL queries using the Github API.

## Playground

The examples I covered in the presentation are all available as pages in the [WritingDSLs](https://github.com/rahul-malik/writing-dsls/tree/master/WritingDSLs.playground) playground.

### Contents
- Page 1: File Hierarchies
- Page 2: Code Generation
- Page 3: GraphQL queries with Github

> Note: The GraphQL playground requires you to create your own access token for Github
