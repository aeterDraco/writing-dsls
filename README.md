# Writing Domain Specific Languages
## Functional Swift Conference 2017
### Rahul Malik (@rmalik)

## Abstract
> A Domain Specific Language (DSL) is a computer programming language of limited expressiveness focused on a particular domain. Most languages you hear of are General Purpose Languages, which can handle most things you run into during a software project. Each DSL can only handle one specific aspect of a system.

Domain specific languages allow us to create an ideal environment for solving a specific problem. In this talk weâ€™ll discuss how to use various language features like recursive enums, trailing closures and higher order functions to create elegant and type-safe domain specific languages. We will go through real-world problems we encountered at Pinterest and the domain specific languages we wrote to solve them.
